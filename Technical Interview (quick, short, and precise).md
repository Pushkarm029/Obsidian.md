# Questions:
**Q. Explain the code where you faced challenges?**
Ans - 
- **Integration and Communication**
- since, i created two folders, one called frontend and another backend. so i got a problem here that how to connect the api endpoints created by backend get accessed by frontend. so i brainstormed and researched for around 2-3 hours then i got to know about createProxyMiddleWare to connect them.
- **Traversing through data in firestore with go**
-  **Creating overlay**
- **Creating Multi Page App**

**0. Tell me a bit about your project.**
this project is known as insta-clone-app. it is built using ReactJS as frontend, goLang as backend and firebase as database. in this webapp, the user can upload image, engage with the community by interacting with their posts by like, comment etc. 
**1. What was the reason behind you building this project?**
from the very early age, i used to think about how these social media apps are built and how they run , what are their architecture. and building a social media app is best way to boost my full stack development skills.
**1. Why have you used these technologies in your project?**
- i used react as frontend because as you may know it is the most popular frontend framework today. because of its popularity , its community support is really vast. which can help me to clear my any doubts. because at that time i was a beginner so this community support is important for me.
- i used firebase as Baas and database because with firebase , i was able to easily create authentication system in few hours. and then i used firestore as a database to store the users and their posts information.
- i used golang as backend because the time i reached at the point where i need to create the backend i got good amount of knowledge about go because i was also trying to contribute in CNCF projects. and i also frontend is wholly built on JS, i wanted to try something new and go is very light and blazing fast tech which is popping in this time.
**1. What would you improve in this project currently?**
there are lot of things are need to be done in this project like 
- fixing infinite like and followers glitch.g0NVp4
- implementing JSON web tokens to make it secure.
- implement messaging using firebase cloud messaging.
- implement videocall using webRTC.
- dockerize this application and then deploy it on microsoft azure.
**1. What would you improve in this project if you were to build it again? (TS)**
- if i create this project from start, i will build it using NextTS. because typescript is industry standard in this decade. and also i would have used tailwind css instead of vanilla CSS because it saves a lot of time.
**1. Limitations of project?**
- infinite Like and Follow.
- no messaging and video call support.
# Best Practices:
1. Revise and fix Codebase
2. fix security issues
3. proper documentation

# During Interview
1. “Always take criticism and feedback properly”.
2. Instead of getting offended or protective of your code, if the interviewer gives feedback, give a positive response and enquire about it more!
3. If time permits, feel free to ask any questions to the interviewer.
4. start and test project before.
5. Be ready to face questions on the architecture of your project (Why did you use a certain design pattern, how are you linking your front and backend)
3. know what each file do (package.json, setupProxy)
