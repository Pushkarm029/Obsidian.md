where python -> displays location of python executable file

why we python runs without passing location ?
cause this location is stored as env

echo $PATH -> possible locations  of file. echo means display and PATH is env.

ls -> list

ls -a -> shows hidden file

mkdir -> create folder

cd -> change directory

open /usr/local/bin -> opens the folder

bash -> open another subshell bash

vim file_name -> to edit file
