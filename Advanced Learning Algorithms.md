### Neuron
- neuron is as a tiny little computer whose only job is to input one number or a few numbers, such as a price, and then to output one number or maybe a few other numbers which in this case is the probability of the T-shirt being a top seller.

- This feature vector is fed to this layer in the middle which then computes three activation values. That is these numbers and these three activation values in turn becomes another vector which is fed to this final output layer that finally outputs the probability of this t-shirt to being a top seller.

- In the first hidden layer, you might find one neuron that is looking for the low vertical line or a vertical edge like that. A second neuron looking for a oriented line or oriented edge like that. The third neuron looking for a line at that orientation, and so on.
